Todo:
* make shutdown (2) BSD #ifdefable
* make -c|--config -f|--foreground options
* make user drop privs setuid/setgid (as squid does)
* "make install"
* add build date and maybe git commit info
* fix buildsystem (no obj/ dir by default)

Done:
+ change signal to sigaction
+ enable IP checking
+ fixed memleak (main.c: client_clean commented out 'cos valgrind said...:])

FAR:
* create ctx structure for runtime config options
* enable runtime control function (ex: UNIX socket, FIFO)
* send quit signal to all on socket error
* strange falldowns ...
* strange client close sockets (many client from 1 host, maybe, unidentified)
* remove userlevel IO FILE * structures in sighandlers
* refcounted message buffers (memory/speed consumption)

MAIN PROBLEM:
  Short Description:
    Poll around several conditions at one time of client thread:
      * wait for incoming from-socket packet (poll/select)
      * wait for incoming from-dispatcher packet (cond var/??)
POSSIBLE SOLVE:
  * stupid: poll/select on timeout, wait condvar on timeout, leads to O(N) latency.
  * a little smarter: two threads on client: sender and receiver.
  * smarter: redesign client thread wakeups from 1/2 really polling threads.
