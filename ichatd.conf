#

# port or userport
# specifies port to listen for client connections
# default value is 6666. specify 0 (zero) here to prevent clients from connecting to this server.
# it may be useful for secondary or forwarding servers.
port 6666

# serverport
# specifies port to listen on for another servers requests
# it is used for server binding (look in original chat server version for Windows for full description)
# default value 6667. again, you can set it to 0 (zero) to prevent connections from another servers
serverport 6667

# reuseaddress
# special
# sometimes TCP/IP connections could not be closed gracefully and they remains pending until timeout value is reached
# so the server upon startup detects that address and port is busy and refuses to start
# so :) this option forces the server to use such address and port
# but if there is another program listening on this port, this option will not help you
# default value 1
# reuseaddress 1
# or
# reuseaddress 0

# serverpassword
# specifies password that all remote servers must to know to be able to connect to this server
# default value 'password'
serverpassword ichatd

# servername
# sepcifies servername that is used for identification purposes...
# default value - IP/HOST pair, generated from system info
# servername MUSTDIE

# logfile
# specifies path to file to which log all debug and informartional messages
# default value is './ichatd.log'
# logfile ./ichatd.log
# or
# logfile /var/log/ichatd.log
logfile ./ichatd.log

# loglevel
# specifies minimum logging info to write to file
# default - note
# currently implemented values:
# { debug | note | warn | fatal }
loglevel debug

# logmessages
# if set to non-zero value, log every message (header only, not data) to logfile
# default value 0
# logmessages 1
#logmessages 1

# pidfile
# file where to store the PID of the server process. the only use is for tracking process existance in scripts, etc.
# default value is '/var/run/ichatd.pid'
pidfile ./ichatd.pid

# server
# describe remote server to connect to. upon startup the server will try to connect to
# specified remote server thus creating a link. you may also specify port on remote server.
# the password must be equal to the password specified on the remote server with serverpassword option.
# you can create as many entries as you need.
# server hostname port password
# or
# server ip port password
# server 127.0.0.1 54321 wis

# serverloops
# allows to connect to (or to accept connections form) servers that have been accepted (connected) already
# default valie 0
# serverloops 1

# maxmsgsize
# if server receives a message from client with length greater than specified,
# the message will be dropped and connection will be closed. do not set this value lower than minheader length.
# default value 8129
# maxmsgsize 8192

# nullclients
# special
# this option was introduced for debugging purposes only and it can provide a SPECTARTOR ability for a chat.
# so i recommend to leave it disabled.
# idea: if client connects to server and DOES NOT PROVIDE identification information, the server will 
# send all broadcast messages to this connection. but the chat usvers will not see such spectator.
# default value is 0
nullclients 1

# minheaderlength
# special
# involved in the process of packet handling. specifies the minimum length of packet (in bytes) to read 
# prior starting processing the packet.
# default value is 12 (lesser values may lead to inability to receive correct client messages)
# DO NOT MODIFY

# initialmsgbufsize
# special
# specify initial memory (in bytes) allocated for each message. may improve performance with big values if
# if all chat messages are big and my improve memory usage with small values if all chat messages
# are small
# default value 1024
# initialmsgbufsize 512
