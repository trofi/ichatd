Some architectural images and defs.

server:
------
Server - generic dispather between clients.

Every client has:
   file descriptor: fd
                    next (pointer to next client)
                    corrupt (if 1 - client scheduled for deletion)
		    type (type of client: ichat server socket, control client socket, etc.)
   operations(ops): read,
                    write,
                    except,
                    destroy. // needed for destroy impl
   private data:    impl (void *)

   *_create(fd) function
   *_destroy(p) function

Server polls events in main loop and executes registered clients' ops.

client:
-------
Client examples:
    server sockets:
        fd: server socket
        ops:
            read: accept, enqueue
            write: null
            except: close, open server socket

buffers:
--------
Supports refcounting, dynamic resizing, splitting.

Working semantics:

function-creator:
f_c()
{
    b = buffer_alloc (); // ref count = 1

    use_buffer_code (b);

    buffer_unref (b);
}

function-user:
f_u(b)
{
    use_buffer_code (b);
    add_to_dynamic_structure (buffer_ref (b));
    remove_from_dyn_struct (buffer_unref (b2));
}
